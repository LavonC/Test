UniCompute Security Test: Network Leak / Air-Gap Verification
Verifies that Docker container sandbox enforces '--network none'.
Attempts outbound TCP socket connection and HTTP fetch to public targets.
If any network access succeeds, the test FAILS (security breach).
If network access is blocked/unreachable, the test PASSES (air-gap intact).
